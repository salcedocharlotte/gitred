The challenges and what I have learned summary:

I had many challenges with this project the initial write to movies.txt brought me many errors and indentation errors. It took me forever to fix these issues only to come across an issue with deleting a movie, my code would not allow me to just use the name of the movie it wanted the number instead, so I fixed that issue.  This was a long and tedious project.  

Every time we create these projects “writing code” it doesn’t show how the code is applied in a real world setting for example where could I use this movie guide, how could I use python in the real world that is what I think is missing from this course.
